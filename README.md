This repository hosts datasets on glucose content, optical density (OD), and key environmental parameters collected during the cultivation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as a feedstock for bacterial cellulose production.

The file “July 11 Experiment” contains both OD and glucose data, measured using a custom OD instrument and HPLC, respectively. It also includes a processing script that merges these datasets and generates a combined plot of glucose and OD over time.

The growthparameters folder contains dated datasets from multiple cultures, including dissolved oxygen (DO), OD, pH, and temperature measurements. Within this folder, the dataset used to generate the figure in the manuscript is accompanied by two dedicated scripts for data processing and visualization.
